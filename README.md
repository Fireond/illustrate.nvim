# Illustrate

Illustrate is a lua plugin for neovim to create and manage vector documents in
your LaTeX and Markdown files for both Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator.

With key bindings you define, you can:

* Create new `.svg` files in the current working directory and opening them in Inkscape / Adobe Illustrator.
* Create new `.ai` (Adobe Illustrator) files in the current working directory and opening them in Inkscape / Adobe Illustrator.
* Using [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) you can search through the
  available `.svg` and `.ai` documents and open them in Inkscape / Adobe Illustrator.

## Contributions, feedback and requests

Happy to accept contributions/pull requests to extend and improve this simple 
plugin. Also open to feedback and requests for new features, if you open a 
GitHub issue.

## Other notes

* This plugin is inspired from [this](https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-figures) Python project from [Gilles Castel](https://github.com/gillescastel) and his excellent blog post [here](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/), but extended to support Adobe Illustrator on top of Inkscape and be a native lua plugin for neovim.
* This is my first neovim plugin and the first time I write a lua program (any feedback is appreciated).
